<td colspan="2"><p>RF Information Service programme is linking information / knowledge seekers (farmers, fisher folk, 
micro-entrepreneur, etc.) and knowledge-holders (universities, research institutions, extension 
department, individual experts – grassroots resource persons, policy makers, innovative 
practitioners, journalists, traders, financial institutions, etc.) through multiple interactive platforms 
for knowledge sharing / broadcasting value addition advisories / getting feedback about the 
advisories and various services to address the rural development issues / livelihood security issues.</p> 
<p>At present, the primary focus is to cover the maximum possible audience in each set of livelihood - 
major crop cultivators, livestock rearers, marine fisher folk, aquaculture, micro-enterprises, etc., to 
provide demand driven information such as pest and disease management, vaccination details for 
livestock, seed treatment, new cultivation methods, government schemes / entitlements, ocean 
state forecast, availability of fish shoal, financial institutions support schemes, civic services, 
education, health, employment news, etc. For executing this the methodology is to focus on 
identifying a small group of individuals of different livelihood with similar information needs for 
periodical need assessment, collecting feedback and content verification. This process leads to refine
and package content. This packaged content will be  broadcast through different communication 
media to communities with similar information needs located in different parts of same districts, the 
neighbouring districts and across the entire State.</p> </td>
